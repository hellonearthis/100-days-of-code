# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Forked and Branched the 100 days of code

**Thoughts:** I really struggle with coding everyday,  so this will be interesting.  I plan to work on node.js electron, react, wordpress and C++

### Day 1: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on learning React

**Thoughts:** I tried to get to grips with 'React AHA Moments' blog post.  Also looked at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webpack-template] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webpack-template) as an easy way to create react projects that use webkit, instead of rolling my own.
