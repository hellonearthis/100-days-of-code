### Day 0: December 29, 2016

### Day 1: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on learning React

**Thoughts:** I tried to get to grips with 'React AHA Moments' blog post.  Also looked at [react-webpack-template] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webpack-template) as an easy way to create react projects that use webkit, instead of rolling my own.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on GreaseMonkey script for Pandora because I am still listening.

**Thoughts:** It had a URL that changes when it thinks youre not listening and a clickbox with an OnClick event.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on GreaseMonkey script for Pandora because I am still listening,  had issues with the basic design so when for a simple option of displaying song names using document.getElementsByClassName("songTitle")[0].innerHTML 
That had a problem that the song name isn't loaded at the time the page os loaded,  so I had to delay that read for 6 seconds

**Thoughts:** Thinking of the main goal, I might use this to send a click event [how-do-i-click-on-this-button-with-greasemonkey](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12252701/how-do-i-click-on-this-button-with-greasemonkey)

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on GreaseMonkey script for Pandora because I am still listening,  I am using the [waitForKeyElements.js](https://gist.github.com/BrockA/2625891)  to check when the pandora ajax page has updated/changed.
After an hour, I am still not getting it to notice the page changes,  so might try that tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Might have to use waitForKeyElements.js on some other ajax style page to see if it's me on pandora.

### Day 6: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got a new Book today so spent some time going through the first few chapters.  [Learning React
Functional Web Development with React and Flux](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049579.do)  It was on sale so...

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A frustrated hour trying to get 'the pandora listing to' going

### Day 9: January 10, 2017

### Day 9: January 11, 2017
